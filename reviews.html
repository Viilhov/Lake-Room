                <p>Casa Barbara is in a great location with fabulous
                    views over the lakes. We felt incredibly welcome to
                    this lovely town
                    house. Our room was very comfortable with a great terrace with beautiful views. Would certainly
                    recommend a relaxing
                    visit to Casa Barbara and the lovely town of Iznajar.</p>

                    little fridge in the room too.</p>

                <p>Barbara is a great host who has everything ready for when you arrive. Puts on the fireplace in the
                    evenings, leaves you
                    a couple of croissants, coffee, milk, juice for breakfast... The views from the room are amazing and
                    the stay is super
                    comfortable. It does not lack anything. I would repeat without hesitation. Also, she didn't care
                    that we left the bikes
                    in the room. We were able to make a lovely route through the surrounding villages, surrounding the
                    reservoir. Watch out
                    for the slopes!</p>

                <p>The owner is super nice, we arrived later and had no problems picking up the key. The fireplace was
                    on, the heating of
                    the room too, the very comfortable bed and the incredible natural surroundings. 100% recommendable
